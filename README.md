# Privacy Policy for ChatGPT Conversation Exporter

Last updated: [Current Date]

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the ChatGPT Conversation Exporter Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects user data.

## 2. Data Collection and Use

Our extension collects and processes the following data:

- **Website Content**: The extension accesses and processes the content of ChatGPT conversations on https://chat.openai.com when activated by the user. This data is used solely for the purpose of exporting the conversation and is not stored by the extension.

- **Google Account Information**: When using the Google Drive export feature, the extension requires access to the user's Google account. This is used only for authenticating with Google Drive and uploading exported files.

We do not collect or store any personal information, authentication information, financial information, health information, or location data.

## 3. Data Storage and Transfer

- Exported conversations are either saved locally to the user's device or uploaded to the user's Google Drive account, depending on the user's choice.
- We do not retain any user data on our servers.
- Data is transferred securely using HTTPS when communicating with Google's servers.

## 4. User Rights and Control

Users have full control over their data:
- The extension only operates when explicitly activated by the user.
- Users can choose whether to export conversations locally or to Google Drive.
- Users can revoke the extension's access to their Google account at any time through their Google Account settings.

## 5. Data Protection

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect user data, including secure HTTPS connections and adherence to Google's security practices for authentication.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The extension uses Google Drive API for file storage when users choose to save exports to Google Drive. Users are encouraged to review Google's Privacy Policy for information on how Google processes their data.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our extension is not intended for use by children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
